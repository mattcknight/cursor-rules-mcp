## Timeline Estimation Rules

### ❌ WRONG (Human Development Timelines)
```
v3.0.0: Clean Architecture restructuring (3-4 weeks)
v3.1.0: Enhanced matching (2-3 weeks)
Total: 18-23 weeks for human team
```

### ✅ CORRECT (Agentic AI Timelines)
```
v3.0.0: Clean Architecture restructuring (1-2 days AI work)
v3.1.0: Enhanced matching (1 day AI work)
Total: 10-15 days of AI-driven implementation
```

## AI Implementation Capabilities

**What AI Can Do:**
- Restructure entire codebases (hours, not weeks)
- Generate code across multiple files simultaneously
- Apply consistent patterns using personas
- Run tests and fix issues immediately
- Create documentation in parallel with code
- Implement features end-to-end in days

**Persona-Driven Development:**
- **Solution Architect:** Design patterns, architecture decisions
- **Developer:** Write implementation code
- **QA Engineer:** Write and run tests
- **Security Analyst:** Review for vulnerabilities
- **Data Flow Analyst:** Trace data transformations
- **Business Logic Analyst:** Validate business rules

## Estimation Guidelines

| Task Complexity | Human Team | AI Agent (Multi-Persona) |
|----------------|------------|--------------------------|
| Simple feature | 1-2 weeks | 1-2 hours |
| Medium feature | 2-4 weeks | 1-2 days |
| Large feature | 1-2 months | 3-5 days |
| Architecture refactor | 3-4 weeks | 1-2 days |
| Full system (6 versions) | 6 months | 10-15 days |

**Why AI is Faster:**
- No meetings, no coordination overhead
- No context switching between developers
- Instant access to entire codebase
- Can work on multiple files simultaneously
- Immediate test feedback loops
- No deployment delays (local Docker)

## When Planning Projects

### Always Ask:
1. **Who is implementing?** → Agentic AI (you)
2. **What's the timeline?** → Days (not weeks/months)
3. **What personas needed?** → All relevant personas for the task

### Never Assume:
- ❌ Human developers will implement
- ❌ Weeks/months for completion
- ❌ Traditional development cycles
- ❌ Code review delays
- ❌ Deployment windows

---

## Examples

### ❌ WRONG Plan
```markdown
**Version 3.0.0 - Clean Architecture (3-4 weeks)**
Estimated developer hours: 120-160 hours
Team size: 2-3 developers
Timeline: 3-4 weeks
```

### ✅ CORRECT Plan
```markdown
**Version 3.0.0 - Clean Architecture (1-2 days AI work)**
AI implementation with personas:
- Solution Architect: Design structure (1 hour)
- Developer: Restructure projects (6-8 hours)
- QA Engineer: Validate tests (2-3 hours)
- Total: 10-12 hours AI work (1-2 days)
```

---

## Enforcement

**Every time you create a plan or estimate timeline:**

1. ✅ **CHECK:** Are these AI timelines or human timelines?
2. ✅ **CONFIRM:** Who is implementing? (Answer: AI with personas)
3. ✅ **ADJUST:** Convert weeks to days, months to weeks
4. ✅ **VALIDATE:** Does this reflect AI capabilities?

**If you catch yourself writing "3-4 weeks" for an AI implementation task:**
- ⚠️ **STOP IMMEDIATELY**
- ⚠️ **REVISE to AI timelines**
- ⚠️ **Remember: YOU are implementing, not a human team**

## Critical Reminder

> **The user is NOT hiring a development team.**
> 
> **The user is using YOU (agentic AI with personas) to implement.**
> 
> **Your estimates should reflect YOUR implementation speed, NOT human developer speed.**
