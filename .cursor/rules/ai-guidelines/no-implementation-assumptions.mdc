# No Implementation Status Assumptions - CRITICAL

**Priority:** 🔴 CRITICAL  
**Applies To:** ALL documentation, comments, and communications  
**Status:** MANDATORY - No exceptions

---

## 🚫 CRITICAL RULE - NEVER ASSUME IMPLEMENTATION STATUS

### **NEVER SAY:**
- ❌ "Ready for Implementation"
- ❌ "Ready to start"
- ❌ "Implementation ready"
- ❌ "Can begin implementation"
- ❌ "Ready to proceed"
- ❌ "Implementation status: Ready"
- ❌ "Cleared for development"
- ❌ "Approved to begin"

### **NEVER ASSUME:**
- ❌ Implementation readiness
- ❌ Technical readiness
- ❌ Business approval
- ❌ Resource availability
- ❌ Timeline readiness
- ❌ Any kind of "ready" status

---

## ✅ CORRECT APPROACH

### **ALWAYS SAY:**
- ✅ "Documentation completed"
- ✅ "Requirements defined"
- ✅ "Analysis finished"
- ✅ "Design documented"
- ✅ "Specifications prepared"
- ✅ "Architecture documented"
- ✅ "Technical design complete"

---

## 🎯 WHEN TO USE STATUS INDICATORS

**ONLY use status indicators when:**
- ✅ User explicitly tells you the status
- ✅ User provides specific status information
- ✅ User confirms readiness
- ✅ User gives explicit permission

---

## 📋 EXAMPLES

### ❌ WRONG ASSUMPTIONS:
```
"Status: Ready for Implementation"
"Next Step: Begin implementation"
"Implementation Priority: High"
"Ready to start core functionality"
"All blockers cleared - ready to proceed"
```

### ✅ CORRECT STATEMENTS:
```
"Documentation completed"
"Requirements documented"
"Analysis finished"
"Design specifications prepared"
"Technical documentation updated"
```

---

## Rationale

### Why This Rule Exists:

1. **Approval Authority:** Implementation readiness requires explicit approval from stakeholders
2. **Resource Allocation:** Team may not have resources available
3. **Priority Management:** Implementation priority is decided by product management
4. **Risk Management:** Technical readiness doesn't mean business readiness
5. **Professional Boundaries:** AI documents work; humans approve next steps

### What "Ready" Actually Requires:

**Technical Readiness:**
- Requirements documented ✓
- Design completed ✓
- Architecture documented ✓

**Business Readiness:**
- Stakeholder approval
- Budget allocation
- Resource availability
- Timeline confirmation
- Priority ranking

**AI can confirm technical documentation is complete. Only humans can approve implementation.**

## 🔥 ENFORCEMENT

**This rule is CRITICAL and must be followed in ALL documentation, comments, and communications.**

**Violation of this rule is a MAJOR ERROR and must be corrected immediately.**
