# CRITICAL: AI Assistant Guidelines

## ⚠️ MANDATORY RULE: File Operations

### NEVER USE CURSOR RULES CACHE

**CRITICAL**: 
- ❌ **NEVER** rely on Cursor's internal rules cache
- ❌ **NEVER** assume rules are cached or available without reading files
- ❌ **NEVER** skip reading rule files because you think they're cached
- ✅ **ALWAYS** read rule files directly using `read_file` tool
- ✅ **ALWAYS** write changes directly to rule files using `write` or `search_replace` tools
- ✅ **ALWAYS** verify rule files exist and contain expected content after making changes
- ✅ **ALWAYS** use file system tools to interact with `.cursor/rules/` files

**Why**: Cursor's rules cache can be lost, corrupted, or out of sync. Always work with actual files on disk.

### File Operation Workflow

**When Reading Rules:**
1. Use `read_file` tool to read `.cursor/rules/` files
2. Never assume content based on cache
3. Always read the actual file

**When Updating Rules:**
1. Use `read_file` to read current content
2. Use `search_replace` or `write` to modify files
3. Use `read_file` again to verify changes were written
4. Never assume changes are saved without verification

**When Creating New Rules:**
1. Use `write` tool to create new `.mdc` files in `.cursor/rules/`
2. Verify file was created using `list_dir` or `read_file`
3. Never assume file creation succeeded without verification

## Rule File Structure

### Location
- All rules MUST be in `.cursor/rules/` directory
- Rules are `.mdc` files (Markdown with frontmatter)
- Rules are organized by category in subdirectories

### Reading Rules
- ✅ Use `read_file` tool to read rule files
- ✅ Use `list_dir` to see available rules
- ✅ Use `grep` to search rule content
- ❌ Never rely on cached rule content

### Updating Rules
- ✅ Use `search_replace` for partial updates
- ✅ Use `write` for complete rewrites
- ✅ Always verify changes with `read_file` after updating
- ❌ Never assume changes are saved without verification

---

## Critical Workflow Rules

### ALWAYS
- ✅ Read rule files directly from disk
- ✅ Write rule changes directly to files
- ✅ Verify file changes after writing
- ✅ Use file system tools, not cache

### NEVER
- ❌ Rely on Cursor's rules cache
- ❌ Assume rules are available without reading files
- ❌ Skip verification of file changes
- ❌ Use cached rule content for decisions
