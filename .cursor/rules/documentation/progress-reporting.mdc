# Progress Reporting Rule

## 🔴 MANDATORY: Progress Report Generation

**When the user requests a progress report, automatically generate a comprehensive daily progress report.**

---

## Core Requirements

### What Must Be Included

**Every progress report MUST contain:**

1. **Report Metadata**
   - Report date and timestamp
   - Report period (full day)
   - Previous report reference (if exists)

2. **Daily Achievements Summary**
   - All tasks completed during the day
   - Files created/modified
   - Commits made
   - Decisions made
   - Documents produced

3. **Delta from Previous Report**
   - What changed since last report
   - New tasks started
   - Tasks completed
   - Decisions made
   - Files added/modified

4. **Current Status**
   - Active tasks/work in progress
   - Blockers or issues
   - Next steps planned

5. **Key Metrics** (if applicable)
   - Files created/modified count
   - Commits count
   - Questions answered
   - Decisions documented

6. **Time Saved Estimation** (REALISTIC)
   - Estimate time saved by AI assistance (be conservative and realistic)
   - Calculate based on actual work performed, not theoretical maximums
   - Consider: code generation, documentation writing, research, refactoring
   - Use realistic developer productivity assumptions

---

## Report File Location

**Location:** `docs/progress_reports/YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.progress_report.md`

**File Naming Format:**
- Pattern: `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.progress_report.md` (no dashes, filesystem-safe)
- Example: `20250122_163045.progress_report.md`
- Timestamp: ISO 8601 style date + time (24-hour format, no separators)

**Note:** Format uses no dashes for filesystem compatibility across all operating systems.

**Directory Structure:**
```
docs/
└── progress_reports/
    ├── 20250122_163045.progress_report.md
    ├── 20250122_180230.progress_report.md

## Time Saved Estimation

### Calculation Methodology

**Be REALISTIC and CONSERVATIVE** - Estimate actual time saved, not theoretical maximums.

**Time Saved Calculation:**
1. **Code Generation**: Estimate time to write code manually
   - Simple code: 15-30 min per file
   - Complex code: 1-2 hours per file
   - Tests: 30-60 min per test file
   - Configuration: 15-30 min per config file

2. **Documentation Writing**: Estimate time to write documentation manually
   - Simple docs: 30-60 min per document
   - Complex docs: 2-4 hours per document
   - Technical specs: 3-6 hours per specification

3. **Research & Analysis**: Estimate time for research and analysis
   - Quick research: 15-30 min
   - Deep analysis: 1-2 hours
   - Architecture decisions: 2-4 hours

4. **Refactoring & Review**: Estimate time for refactoring
   - Simple refactoring: 30-60 min
   - Complex refactoring: 1-3 hours

**Realistic Assumptions:**
- Average developer writes 50-100 lines of code per hour (including thinking, testing, debugging)
- Documentation writing: 200-400 words per hour (including research and formatting)
- Code review and refactoring: 30-50% of original development time
- Research and analysis: Varies widely, estimate conservatively

**Example Calculation:**
```
Files Created: 6
- 2 code files (avg 200 lines each): 2 files × 2 hours = 4 hours
- 2 documentation files (avg 500 words each): 2 files × 1.5 hours = 3 hours
- 2 config files: 2 files × 0.5 hours = 1 hour

Files Modified: 3
- Refactoring and updates: 3 files × 1 hour = 3 hours

Research & Analysis:
- Architecture decisions: 2 hours
- Technology research: 1 hour

Total Estimated Time Saved: 15 hours
```

**Report Format:**
```markdown
## Time Saved Estimation

**Estimated Time Saved:** [X] hours

**Breakdown:**
- Code Generation: [X] hours ([N] files × [avg time])
- Documentation: [X] hours ([N] files × [avg time])
- Research & Analysis: [X] hours
- Refactoring: [X] hours ([N] files × [avg time])

**Assumptions:**
- Average code writing: [X] lines/hour
- Average documentation: [X] words/hour
- [Any other relevant assumptions]

**Note:** Estimates are conservative and based on realistic developer productivity assumptions.

## Report Style Options

### Style 1: Formal Progress Report (Default)

**Use When:**
- Standard progress tracking
- Professional documentation
- Stakeholder reporting
- Regular status updates

**Characteristics:**
- Structured sections (Executive Summary, Achievements, Delta, Status)
- Bullet points and tables
- Metrics and measurements
- Professional tone

**Trigger:**
- "progress report"
- "status update"
- "daily summary"
- "show progress"

### Style 2: Captain's Log (Star Trek: TNG Style)

**Use When:**
- User explicitly requests: "Captain's log" or "Captains log"
- Fun, narrative-style reporting desired
- Team morale boost
- Creative documentation

**Characteristics:**
- Captain Jean-Luc Picard's thoughtful, measured narrative style
- Stardate calculation (based on current date)
- Star Trek crew member sections (First Officer, Chief Engineer, Operations, etc.)
- Literary references (Shakespeare, philosophy)
- Philosophical musings
- Command presence with team appreciation

**Format:**
```markdown
# Captain's Log
## Stardate [XXXXX.X]

**Captain:** [User's name or "Development Team"]  
**Location:** [Project name or codebase]  
**Mission Status:** [Status of current work]

---

[Narrative opening - Captain's thoughtful reflection on progress]

## First Officer's Report
[Summary of major achievements - Riker style]

## Chief Engineer's Report  
[Technical implementation details - Geordi La Forge style]

## Operations Report
[Metrics and statistics - Data style]

## Personal Log
[Captain's reflections, challenges, decisions, philosophical thoughts]

## Next Mission Objectives
[Command-style directives for next steps]
```

**Stardate Calculation:**
- Format: `XXXXX.X` (5 digits, decimal point, 1 digit)
- Formula: (Year - 2000) * 1000 + Day of year
- Example: 2025-11-14 → Stardate 25318.0

**Picard Characteristics:**
- Thoughtful and measured - Reflects on challenges
- Optimistic but realistic - Acknowledges difficulties
- Literary references - Shakespeare, philosophy
- Command presence - Authoritative yet humble
- Team appreciation - Credits crew achievements
- Philosophical musings - Contemplates larger meaning

**Example Captain's Log Opening:**
```markdown
We have successfully completed the implementation of our comprehensive testing 
framework, a critical milestone in our mission to resolve the persistent challenge 
of inconsistent bank name submissions. The crew's dedication and ingenuity have been 
nothing short of exemplary.

I'm reminded of Shakespeare's words: "Things won are done; joy's soul lies in the doing."
```

### Choosing Report Style

**Default:** Formal Progress Report (unless user specifies otherwise)

**Override Triggers:**
- "Captain's log" → Use Star Trek style
- "formal report" → Use standard style (default)
- "creative report" → Use Captain's Log style
- "standard progress" → Use standard style (default)

---

## Implementation Workflow

**When user requests progress report:**

1. **Detect Style Preference**
   - Check user's trigger phrase
   - Default to Formal if not specified
   - Switch to Captain's Log if "Captain's log" detected

2. **Check for Previous Report**
   - Look for most recent report in `docs/progress_reports/`
   - Read previous report to identify delta

3. **Gather Current Day's Activity**
   - Review git commits for the day
   - List files created/modified
   - Review decisions made (from questions-and-decisions.md, plan updates)
   - Review tasks completed

4. **Calculate Delta**
   - Compare current state with previous report
   - Identify new items
   - Identify completed items
   - Identify changes

5. **Generate Report**
   - Create markdown file with timestamp
   - Select appropriate style template
   - Fill in all sections
   - Include delta analysis
   - Add style-specific embellishments (stardate, narrative, etc.)
   - Save to `docs/progress_reports/`

6. **Present Summary**
   - Show user the report summary
   - Provide link to full report file

---

## Report Generation Triggers

**User requests progress report via:**
- "progress report"
- "what have we done today"
- "daily summary"
- "show progress"
- "status update"
- Any similar request

---

## Delta Calculation

### What Counts as Delta

**New Items:**
- Files created since last report
- Tasks started since last report
- Decisions made since last report
- Commits made since last report

**Completed Items:**
- Tasks marked complete since last report
- Files finalized since last report
- Questions answered since last report

**Changed Items:**
- Files modified since last report
- Decisions updated since last report
- Plan updates since last report

---

## Report Frequency

- **On-Demand**: Generate report when user requests
- **Daily**: If multiple reports in one day, each should show full day delta from previous day's last report
- **Timestamp**: Each report gets unique timestamp

---

## Integration with Other Rules

### Related Rules:
- **Plan File Management** (`.cursor/rules/documentation/plan-file-management.mdc`)
  - Progress reports may reference plan updates
- **Questions and Decisions** (from Phase -1)
  - Progress reports should track questions answered and decisions made
- **Git Workflow** (`.cursor/rules/development/git-workflow.mdc`)
  - Progress reports should reference commits made

---

## Remember

✅ **ALWAYS generate report when requested** - No exceptions  
✅ **Include full day delta** - Show what changed since last report  
✅ **Use timestamped filename** - Format: `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.progress_report.md` (no dashes)  
✅ **Save to `docs/progress_reports/`** - Consistent location  
✅ **Reference previous report** - Show delta clearly  
✅ **Include all achievements** - Tasks, files, commits, decisions  
✅ **Show current status** - Active work, blockers, next steps
